            <p>
              I'm Md. Masrafi Bin Seraj, hailing from the historic district
              Bagerhat, Bangladesh. Currently, I'm in my final year pursuing a
              degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Jashore University
              of Science and Technology (JUST). Computers and coding have always
              fascinated me, serving as the ultimate playground for solving
              intricate puzzles and unraveling the wonders of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my academic journey, I've enthusiastically participated
              in a variety of programming contests, both online and offline.
              Competing in renowned events such as the ICPC Regionals and
              various IUPCs has not only been a thrilling experience but has
              also been instrumental in refining my coding skills and fostering
              a spirit of continuous improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond competitions, my passion extends to full-stack development,
              where I revel in the process of crafting seamless digital
              experiences from front-end design to back-end functionality.
              Additionally, my curiosity is piqued by the vast potential of
              Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as I explore the
              exciting realm of teaching machines to emulate human cognition.
